# Brief Description of  The Research Problem -
```
Excessive digital screen use among students during and after the COVID-19 pandemic
has led to significant health issues. With educational activities shifting entirely
online, students experienced prolonged screen exposure and reduced physical activity,
contributing to various health complications.The lack of movement, poor posture,
and increased stress levels exacerbated these problems.Common health concerns include
weakened bones and muscles,immune system issues, obesity, and cardiovascular problems. Additionally, 
prolonged screen time has led to posture-related issues such as back and neck pain,
as well as eye problems like Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). The absence of effective monitoring
and intervention has further increased the risk of long-term health consequences.

# Brief Description of  The Research Solution -
```
To address these issues, this research aims to develop a system that utilizes image
processing to monitor student activity. The system will track blinking rates, screen time,
posture, and facial expressions to detect signs of stress. By analyzing these factors, the system
will provide real-time reminders to encourage students to take breaks, stretch, or
adjust their posture. This approach seeks to minimize health risks associated with excessive
screen use and promote healthier study habits among students.
